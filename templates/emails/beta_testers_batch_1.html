<h3>Once You're In, Here's What We'd Love You to Do</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Explore the platform freely</li>
  <li>Try out every available feature</li>
  <li>Share honest feedback: what worked, what felt confusing, what needs refinement</li>
</ul>

<p>Your input will directly shape the future of BowlersNetwork. You’re not just testing — you’re helping build something new.</p>

<h3>Early Tester Perks at Global Launch</h3>

<ul>
  <li>An <strong>exclusive trading card</strong> available only to early testers</li>
  <li>A <strong>lifetime Founding Member badge</strong> on your profile</li>
</ul>

<h3>Your Access URL:</h3>

<a href="{{access_url}}">{{access_url}}</a>

<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Please note: The access URL above is your ONLY entry point into the BowlersNetwork beta.</p>

<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">There is no signup or login screen during this phase.</li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Opening the link logs you in automatically and saves your session.</li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">If you switch browsers or devices, you must use the same access URL again.</li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Please keep it safe — this link is your key to the beta.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you again for joining us at this early stage. We’re excited to build with you!</p>

<p>Warm regards, <br> The BowlersNetwork Team</p>
