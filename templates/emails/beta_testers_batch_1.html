  <li>A <strong>lifetime Founding Member badge</strong> on your profile</li>
</ul>

<h3>Your Access URL:</h3>

<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Please note: The access URL above is your ONLY entry point into the BowlersNetwork beta.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is no signup or login screen during this phase.</li>
  <li>Opening the link logs you in automatically and saves your session.</li>
  <li>If you switch browsers or devices, you must use the same access URL again.</li>
  <li>Please keep it safe — this link is your key to the beta.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you again for joining us at this early stage. We’re excited to build with you!</p>

<p>Warm regards, <br> The BowlersNetwork Team</p>
